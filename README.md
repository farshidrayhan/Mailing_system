# Python for Sending mails via Gmail 
Using the codes in "Final scripts" folder one can send bcc mails to multiple authors. 
The interesting part is that rather than sending a general msg, one can put a name of the reciever in the mail to make it more personal 
dispite of it being a BCC mail.

The folder "intial go" contains the simpler seperate scripts for sending mail via gmail using python.
